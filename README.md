# Airbnb NYC Listings: Working with ML Python Tools

This project marks the **beginning of the Airbnb NYC Listings analysis series**, where I practiced foundational data analysis and machine learning preparation skills using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The lab focuses on building familiarity with essential Python libraries for machine learning workflows.

## Objective

The goal of this lab was to **get hands-on practice with core ML data tools in Python**, including data creation, manipulation, analysis, and visualization — using the **Airbnb NYC listings dataset** as a real-world example.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Work with NumPy
- Created and manipulated **NumPy arrays**.  
- Practiced using key **NumPy functions** for numerical computation and data transformation.  
- Understood how to perform **vectorized operations** efficiently instead of using loops.

### 2. Work with Pandas
- Built **Pandas DataFrames** from arrays and dictionaries.  
- Loaded the **Airbnb NYC listings dataset** into a DataFrame for exploration.  
- Practiced selecting, filtering, and summarizing data using **Pandas methods**.  
- Used **DataFrame.describe()**, **.info()**, and **.head()** to quickly inspect data quality and structure.

### 3. Analyze the Data
- Applied **NumPy and Pandas** to calculate descriptive statistics, such as means, medians, and correlations.  
- Explored relationships between variables like **price**, **accommodations**, and **neighborhood**.  
- Identified potential trends and outliers through quick numerical summaries.

### 4. Visualize the Data
- Created clear and informative **visualizations** using **Matplotlib**.  
- Plotted histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts to understand data distributions and relationships.  
- Practiced adjusting figure size, titles, and labels for readability.

## Notes & Tips Learned

- In **Jupyter Notebooks**, variables can be displayed by:
  - Simply writing the variable name, or  
  - Using the `print()` function for formatted output.  
- Combining **NumPy’s efficiency** with **Pandas’ flexibility** allows for fast and intuitive data exploration.  
- Visualization is key for understanding trends before any modeling step.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** – Efficient numerical computation  
- **Pandas** – DataFrame manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization and plotting

## Key Takeaways

- Learned to create and manipulate arrays and DataFrames.  
- Practiced using NumPy and Pandas for efficient exploratory analysis.  
- Gained experience visualizing real-world data with Matplotlib.  
- Built a solid foundation for future machine learning work on the same dataset.
